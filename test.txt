You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write code to compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.


caught_speeding(60, False) → 0
caught_speeding(65, False) → 1
caught_speeding(65, True) → 0


We want make a package of goal kilos of chocolate. We have small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). Return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. Return -1 if it can't be done.


make_chocolate(4, 1, 9) → 4
make_chocolate(4, 1, 10) → -1
make_chocolate(4, 1, 7) → 2


Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

Simply, 2 lists value[0,..,n-1] and weight[0,..,n-1] is given. Each weight has a corresponding value. You will be given a bag of total capacity W. Obtain the maximum value of bag with capacity W by filling it with items.You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or don’t pick it.
